* Description: The first image shows what pops up when the user runs the file in the terminal.
It is a display of every item that is available in the mySQL database.
There are 10 items total so I needed 2 screenshots to capture all the items.
The 2nd screenshot captures the rest of the items.

* This next image shows the rest of the items as well as the 1st prompt from inquirer.
It asks the user what they would like to buy with only product name in a drop down list
User can use up and down arrows to select an item and hit enter.

Image 4:
* Part 1 shows that when the user selects "carrots", the 2nd prompt of how many units pops up
* Part 2 shows when user types in 20 units of carrots, the total cost shows up
* Total cost is price multiplied by units bought - it re-logs the carrot data so user can see
* Also, it alerts "Congrats you bought the item"
